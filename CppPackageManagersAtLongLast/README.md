# C++ Package Managers - At Long Last

## About the Talk
[The talk summary is coming soon.]

The talk was given at:

- [Graz Qt/C++11 Meetup (Graz, Austria on September 13th, 2017)](https://www.meetup.com/Graz-Qt-C-11-Meetup/events/240890310/)

## Code Samples
The talk does not come with any code samples prepared upfront. Instead, during the talk we create a demo C++ application that depends on several C and C++ libraries. The application and the process of its creation tangibly demonstrate the usage of the [Conan C/C++ package manager](https://conan.io/).
